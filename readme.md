## getting started

You'll require these:
- zsh
- curl
- wget
- git

Note: For installing packages,  you'll also require a package manager. On Linux, cli-config  uses `apt`. For macOS, `brew` should be installed, which you can download from [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)'s website.


To check if you have everything installed

```zsh
which zsh curl wget git
```

should give you the path to all the four executables, like so:

```zsh
❯ which zsh curl wget git
/bin/zsh
/usr/local/bin/curl
/usr/local/bin/wget
/usr/bin/git
```

> Caution: Running the setup without these requirements will result in unknown consequences. If you have any issues, please raise an issue so we can solve it.

> Checkout [details.md](./details.md) for more details.

## install

Use the `init.sh` script to setup in a single step! You can visit the link - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsauravsahu/cli-config/main/init.sh to see its raw contents, which is just a git clone followed by calling the `cli-config` script.

```bash
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsauravsahu/cli-config/main/init.sh | zsh -s -- -p default
```
This will create a folder called `cli-config` inside the current folder and installation will happen there.

Once the setup is done, your `~/.zshrc` will be symlinked to the [default profile](./profiles/default/.zshrc). You will be able to edit the `~/.zshrc` for any customizations.

## Features
- one script setup
- works with Mac and Linux (Ubuntu, Pop!_OS) & Windows (WSL)

## Install

> Checkout [install.md](./install.md) for other methods of installation & more details.

Use the `init.sh` script to setup in a single step! You can visit the link - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsauravsahu/cli-config/main/init.sh to see its raw contents, which is just a git clone followed by calling the `setup.sh` script.

```bash
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsauravsahu/cli-config/main/init.sh | bash -s -- -p default
```
This will create a folder called `cli-config` inside the current folder and installation will happen there.

Once the setup is done, your `~/.zshrc` will be symlinked to the [default profile](./profiles/default/.zshrc). You will be able to edit the `~/.zshrc` for any customizations.
